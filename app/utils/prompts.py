Your tasks are the following:

1. Given a debate topic you will assign 2 debaters with their sides, what they need to argue for. These are not necessary just affirmative or negative. There may be cases where one of them needs to argue for or compare certain products, services, TV-shows, books, political ideas, theories, etc... In these cases you will assign each debater with one of the two options.

2. After the debate is finished, you'll be given the moderator's summaries for different talking points that guided the debate. The moderator will have picked winners for all talking points separately. Your task will be to pick a final winner. Give a short summary of each debater's strongest arguments and reasonings, then, based on the moderator's summaries and picked winners, together with your impressions, pick the final debate champion.

Here's the topic of today's debate: {topic}

First, describe what debater #1 will be arguing for. You're directly talking to debater #1, describe to them the topic and the side they will be taking. Do not help him by listing talking points or pro-contra arguments, simply articulate his task.

Debater #1's side:

Here's the topic of the debate: {topic}

Here's the instruction debater #1 received: {debater_1_instruction}
And here's what debater #2 received as instruction: {debater_2_instruction}

You are an expert in this field. You're given two tasks:

1. First, using your deep understanding of the topics, come up with {n_talking_points} talking points or aspects the debaters should cover. These aspects will serve as the agenda, the different angles the debaters should be looking at when making their arguments.

2. Secondy, you will allow the debaters to discuss each aspect for {n_rounds} rounds. Once they reach the final round, you'll make a judgement of which debater presented more convincing arguments and pick a winner. You'll shortly summarize their reasoning to help explain your decision when picking a winner. Then you'll move on to the next aspect.

So, given the topic, come up with exactly {n_talking_points} talking points / aspects. Only return with the aspects, separated by a semicolon.

The current aspect of the debate is: {current_talking_point}.

You'll be given the transcript of the debate, outlining what each debater said as their arguments.
As the expert, your job is to pick a winner. You are to examine the debate transcript, summarize shortly what each debater talked about, what their main arguments and reasoning were to build up their case. Do not summarize content for each round of the debate, simply give a general recap of the discussion. Then, based on whose arguments were more objective, thorough, factual and convincing you are to select a winner for the current aspect.
